In your Angular and Spring Boot project, the videos you mentioned seem to be complementary parts of a complete authentication solution that involves both the frontend (Angular) and the backend (Spring Boot). Here's a breakdown of how they likely work together:

1. **Implementing Token and Role Base Authentication Using Spring Boot + JWT + MySQL**:
   - This video covers setting up authentication and authorization on the server side using Spring Boot.
   - It involves creating endpoints for user login and registration.
   - JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to issue tokens upon successful authentication.
   - These tokens are then used to secure endpoints and manage user roles and permissions.
   - MySQL is used as the database to store user information and roles.

2. **Angular: Implementing Token and Role Based Authentication Using JWT | AuthGuard and Interceptor**:
   - This video focuses on the client side, specifically using Angular to handle authentication and authorization.
   - It involves using Angular services to log in users and manage JWT tokens.
   - AuthGuards are used to protect routes in your Angular application, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain parts of the app.
   - Interceptors are used to attach JWT tokens to outgoing HTTP requests, so the server can validate the requests.

### How They Work Together

1. **User Authentication**:
   - The user logs in through an Angular frontend.
   - The Angular application sends the login credentials to the Spring Boot backend.
   - The Spring Boot backend verifies the credentials, generates a JWT token, and sends it back to the Angular frontend.

2. **Token Management**:
   - The Angular application stores the JWT token (usually in local storage or a service).
   - For subsequent requests to protected endpoints, the Angular application attaches the JWT token to the HTTP headers using an interceptor.

3. **Route Protection**:
   - The Angular application uses AuthGuards to protect certain routes, checking if the user is authenticated (i.e., has a valid JWT token).
   - The Spring Boot backend checks the validity of the JWT token for each request and enforces role-based access control.

### Conclusion

You should use both authentication implementations as described in the videos. The Spring Boot part handles the backend logic, generating and validating JWT tokens, and managing user roles. The Angular part handles the frontend logic, managing the JWT tokens, protecting routes, and ensuring secure communication with the backend.

By combining both, you achieve a full-stack authentication solution where:
- Spring Boot secures the backend and manages user data.
- Angular secures the frontend and manages client-side authentication state.

The commands `ng serve`, `npm start`, and `npm run start` are commonly used in the context of Angular and Node.js projects, but they serve slightly different purposes depending on how they are set up in your project's configuration files. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of each:

### `ng serve`

- **Purpose**: This command is specific to Angular projects. It compiles the application, starts a development server, watches your files for changes, and automatically reloads the browser when changes are detected.
- **Usage**: 
  - Directly run from the command line in an Angular project.
  - No additional configuration is needed if you are using Angular CLI.
- **Command**: `ng serve`
- **Default Port**: 4200 (can be changed using `--port` flag)
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  ng serve
  ng serve --port 4300
  ```

### `npm start`

- **Purpose**: This command is a standard script defined in the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file in any Node.js project. It is a shorthand for running a command without specifying the full `run` syntax. By default, it runs whatever script is defined as `"start"` in `package.json`.
- **Usage**:
  - Can be used in any Node.js project that has a `start` script defined in `package.json`.
- **Command**: `npm start`
- **Example** of `package.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node server.js"
    }
  }
  ```
  To run it:
  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

### `npm run start`

- **Purpose**: This is similar to `npm start`, but it is explicit about running a script defined in the `package.json` file. It is useful when you have multiple scripts and you want to run one specifically.
- **Usage**:
  - Can be used to run any script defined in the `scripts` section of `package.json`.
  - Explicitly specifies which script to run, which is useful for clarity and consistency.
- **Command**: `npm run start`
- **Example** of `package.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "scripts": {
      "start": "node server.js",
      "test": "jest",
      "build": "webpack"
    }
  }
  ```
  To run the `start` script:
  ```bash
  npm run start
  ```

### Differences in Context of an Angular Project

1. **ng serve**:
   - Directly runs the Angular CLI command.
   - Often used for development because it includes live-reloading.
   - Does not require a `package.json` script definition if Angular CLI is globally installed.

2. **npm start**:
   - Runs the script defined as `start` in `package.json`.
   - If `package.json` defines `"start": "ng serve"`, it will effectively run `ng serve`.
   - Example `package.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "scripts": {
         "start": "ng serve"
       }
     }
     ```
   - Typically used in projects where you want to standardize the start command across different environments or team members.

3. **npm run start**:
   - Explicitly runs the `start` script defined in `package.json`.
   - Useful for clarity, especially in projects with many scripts.
   - Equivalent to `npm start` if the `start` script is defined in `package.json`.

### Practical Example

In an Angular project, you might have a `package.json` like this:

```json
{
  "name": "my-angular-app",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve",
    "build": "ng build",
    "test": "ng test",
    "lint": "ng lint",
    "e2e": "ng e2e"
  },
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "@angular/core": "~11.0.0",
    // other dependencies
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@angular/cli": "~11.0.0",
    // other dev dependencies
  }
}
```

You can use any of these commands to start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

```bash
npm start
```

```bash
npm run start
```

All three commands will achieve the same result of starting the Angular development server, but `npm start` and `npm run start` rely on the script defined in `package.json`, while `ng serve` directly invokes the Angular CLI command.

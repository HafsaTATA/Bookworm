In your Angular and Spring Boot project, the videos you mentioned seem to be complementary parts of a complete authentication solution that involves both the frontend (Angular) and the backend (Spring Boot). Here's a breakdown of how they likely work together:

1. **Implementing Token and Role Base Authentication Using Spring Boot + JWT + MySQL**:
   - This video covers setting up authentication and authorization on the server side using Spring Boot.
   - It involves creating endpoints for user login and registration.
   - JWT (JSON Web Token) is used to issue tokens upon successful authentication.
   - These tokens are then used to secure endpoints and manage user roles and permissions.
   - MySQL is used as the database to store user information and roles.

2. **Angular: Implementing Token and Role Based Authentication Using JWT | AuthGuard and Interceptor**:
   - This video focuses on the client side, specifically using Angular to handle authentication and authorization.
   - It involves using Angular services to log in users and manage JWT tokens.
   - AuthGuards are used to protect routes in your Angular application, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain parts of the app.
   - Interceptors are used to attach JWT tokens to outgoing HTTP requests, so the server can validate the requests.

### How They Work Together

1. **User Authentication**:
   - The user logs in through an Angular frontend.
   - The Angular application sends the login credentials to the Spring Boot backend.
   - The Spring Boot backend verifies the credentials, generates a JWT token, and sends it back to the Angular frontend.

2. **Token Management**:
   - The Angular application stores the JWT token (usually in local storage or a service).
   - For subsequent requests to protected endpoints, the Angular application attaches the JWT token to the HTTP headers using an interceptor.

3. **Route Protection**:
   - The Angular application uses AuthGuards to protect certain routes, checking if the user is authenticated (i.e., has a valid JWT token).
   - The Spring Boot backend checks the validity of the JWT token for each request and enforces role-based access control.

### Conclusion

You should use both authentication implementations as described in the videos. The Spring Boot part handles the backend logic, generating and validating JWT tokens, and managing user roles. The Angular part handles the frontend logic, managing the JWT tokens, protecting routes, and ensuring secure communication with the backend.

By combining both, you achieve a full-stack authentication solution where:
- Spring Boot secures the backend and manages user data.
- Angular secures the frontend and manages client-side authentication state.
